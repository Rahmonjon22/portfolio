                    Passionate about personal growth. It was just decade ago when I discovered my passion for growing and helping others grow. At that time, I was 19 and in my final year of College when I learnt that "Whenever we think we are good, we can be even better".

                    I have been living in Scandinavia and Baltic Countries for the last decade before I moved to Germany in the middle of 2019, Since then I have been learning German (currently B2) language while working in German industry.

                    I had the opportunity to become as Fullstack: Web-developer in 2020. since then I have been studying and doing daily exercises in Digital Career Institute here in DÃ¼sseldorf.

                    My specialties include quickly learning new skills and programming languages, problem solving, responsive design principles, website optimisation.

                    So far I have JavaScript, HTML, CSS, jQuery, Bootstrap, and Git/GitHub under my belt.
                    Currently I'm improving in learning React, SQL, Node.JS, MongoDB, and Express.JS. I'm still enthusiastically grabbing onto any other programming languages, frameworks, or principles I can integrate into the coding web in my head.
