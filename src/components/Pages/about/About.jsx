                        <p>
                            I am a Junior Web Developer for Frontend & Backend. As new comer into IT industry,
                            I am writing to express my interest in the Web-Developer position
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            My backgroud is that I have been living in Scandinavia and Baltic Countries for the last decade before
                            I moved to Germany in the middle of 2019,
                            Since then I have been learning German (currently B2) language while working in German industry.<br />

                            As a person, I am very easy to communicate. in terms of work attitude,
                            I am fully focused on given task and do it on time.<br />

                            I had the opportunity to become as Fullstack: Web-developer in 2020. since then
                            I have been studying and doing daily exercises in Digital Career Institute here in DÃ¼sseldorf.<br />

                            My character include quickly learning new skills and programming languages, problem solving,
                            responsive design principles, website optimisation.<br />

                            So far I have JavaScript, HTML, CSS, jQuery, Bootstrap, and Git/GitHub under my belt.
                            Currently I'm improving in learning React, SQL, Node.JS, MongoDB, and Express.JS.<br />

                            I'm still enthusiastically grabbing onto any other programming languages, frameworks, or principles
                            I can integrate into the coding web in my head.
